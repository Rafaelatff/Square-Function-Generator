# Scope and Data Document of the project

Silly project to test Github project interface and do some electronic/firmware/mechanical tasks.

# Scope 

## Purpose 

I wish to create a device where I can control a PWM signal or two. Its frequencies, time activated and duty cicles. 

## Outputs

To know which are going to be my inputs, first I need to know my outputs. I can have the same variation for both outputs.

|   | Value |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Frequency  | 10 to 50 Hz |
| Voltage  | 10 ~ 15 V  |
| Current  | 700 ~ 1000 uA  |
| Resistance | 10.6 k to 13.4 k |
| Time active | 30 to 50 minutes |

Bipolar voltage. Resting duration of 20 ms.

I wish to use, as interface: 

* A display, to show information (also information that I can control).
* Connector to connect test lids (like for workbench - banana cable with crocodile clips).

## Inputs



## Tests

NOTE: Check time accuracy with 10 (up to 18) measurements. I will try to evolve the project by dedicating time from 1 to 3 times per week.
